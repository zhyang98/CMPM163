This is part1 of CMPM163 homework

A. Design a 3D scene (30 pts)
Using Unity, create a scene with at least 3 objects and 3 lights.
— Each object will use a different shader, e.g., a Phong shader, a shader that applies a
texture, a vertex displacement shader, etc. At least one of the objects must both be
textured and react to lighting.
— Each object and light in the scene will move or rotate.
(The TAs will show you how to create and load in more complex shapes using Blender in
this week’s Lab sections. You can also use .obj or other 3D data files, for example, taken
from the Google Poly library.)
