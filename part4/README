D. Discuss a visual effect (10 pts)
Take a screenshot (or photo) of an interesting visual effect you noticed in a video game or
computational artwork. In a few paragraphs, describe the effect. What do you like about it?
Does the effect change depending on the camera view? The lights? Is it an effect that
updates the geometry itself, or change the color of the pixels, or does it alter a texture?
How do you think it was created? What is the effect called? Do some research/Googling
and see if you can find papers, online tutorials, or blog posts that give insight into how it
was created and how you might emulate it in a Unity shader.
