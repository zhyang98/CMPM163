C. Game of life using shaders (40 pts)
In this exercise, you will create a multi-color game of life that extends the code I provided
in class (i.e., using the “ping-pong” strategy) to follow any of the rules described here:

— Choose your own colors, number of states, etc.
— You can use these (non-shader) examples as inspiration, or come up with your own
ideas: http://jsfiddle.net/awilliams47/LJnue/, http://xpl.github.io/expression/.
Another option for this exercise is to instead use the game of life I showed in class and
place it on an object of your choice (instead of a full screen plane).
